# Firestore Extended (web and node.js)

Simplify the work with complex and deep objects while retaining all the great benefits from Firebase Firestore.

```bash
npm install firebase rxjs firestore-extended --save
```

Firestore splits its data up into collections and documents which is what allows it to be scalable and fast.

The issues that this can cause is that the best way to store your data might not be the best way to work with and display that data.

It can also be more difficult to figure out how to store your data in a way that is not only cheap in terms of reads but also cheap in terms
of performance/speed.

Firestore Extended is meant to help developers solve these issues.

### Demo

You can find a simple demo in projects/demo.

It can be run locally if you provide your own firebaseConfig in the environment file or you can find a running demo here:

> Steps to run locally:
> <ol>
>    <li>Clone this repo</li>
>    <li>Setup a firebase project and place the config 'firebaseConfig' here: projects/demo/src/environments/firebase-secure.ts and export it.</li>
>    <li>Run the following commands:</li>

npm install
npm run start
```

## Using the library

This will add and read the `Address` in a collection inside each `Restaurant` Document.

``example.fs.service.ts``

```ts
import {FirestoreItem} from 'firestore-extended';

export interface Address extends FirestoreItem {
  zipCode: string;
  city: string;
  line1: string;
}

export interface Restaurant extends FirestoreItem {
  address: Address
}

const restaurantSubCollectionWriters: SubCollectionWriter[] = [
  // add address sub Collection inside each Example Document
  {name: 'address'},
];

const restaurantSubCollectionQueries: SubCollectionQuery[] = [
  // listen for address sub Collection inside each Example Document
  {name: 'address'},
];

export class RestaurantFsService { // <-- Service for listening/writing to Firestore

  app: FirebaseApp;
  firestoreExt: FirestoreExt;  //
  restaurantCollectionRef: CollectionReference<Restaurant>;
  firestore: Firestore;

  constructor() {
    this.app = initializeApp(environment.firebase); // only call this once per application
    this.firestore = getFirestore(this.app);
    this.firestoreExt = new FirestoreExt(this.app);  //  initialize FirestoreExt with firebase app
    this.collectionRef = collection<Restaurant>(this.firestore, 'restaurants');
  }

  listenForRestaurants$(): Observable<FireItem<Restaurant>[]> {
    return this.firestoreExt.listenForCollection$<Restaurant>(this.collectionRef);
  }
}

```
